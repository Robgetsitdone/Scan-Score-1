  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Score the Label — Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Score the Label (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Data stored on your device only (not sent to our servers):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scan history</strong> — Products you’ve scanned, scores, ingredient flags, and notes (stored locally, up to the last 50 scans).</li>
    <li><strong>Favorites</strong> — Which scans you mark as favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> — Your “ingredients to avoid” and other in-app settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison selection</strong> — Products you temporarily choose to compare.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Data used when you use certain features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photo scan</strong> — When you take or upload a photo of a food label, the image is sent to our servers to analyze ingredients and generate a score. We do not use this data to identify you and do not retain it for longer than needed to process your request.</li>
    <li><strong>Barcode scan</strong> — The barcode number and your preference settings are sent to our servers so we can look up the product (via Open Food Facts) and analyze it. We do not store this in a way that identifies you personally.</li>
    <li><strong>Compare</strong> — When you compare two products, summary data for those products is sent to our servers to generate the comparison. We do not use this to build a profile about you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To analyze food labels and barcodes and return scores, ingredient flags, and alternatives.</li>
    <li>To personalize scoring based on your “ingredients to avoid” preferences when you use scan or compare.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your data for advertising targeting or to build a marketing profile.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following services to provide the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> — Label images and product text are sent to OpenAI’s API to generate ingredient analysis and scores. Their use of data is governed by their privacy policy: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Food Facts</strong> — When you scan a barcode, we request product data from Open Food Facts to show ingredients and nutrition. Their policy: <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-and-conditions-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world.openfoodfacts.org</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not control these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy and terms.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Scan history, favorites, and preferences stay on your device until you clear them in the app or uninstall. We do not maintain a long-term database of your scans or identity. Data sent for analysis (e.g., images) is processed and not retained for identification purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard practices to protect data in transit (e.g., HTTPS). Data on your device is stored in your device’s local storage and is subject to your device’s security and your choices (e.g., clearing app data).</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear scan history and reset preferences from within the app.</li>
    <li>You can uninstall the app at any time; local data will be removed with the app.</li>
    <li>If you are in a region that grants additional rights (e.g., access, deletion, portability), contact us and we will respond in line with applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>Score the Label is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have received such information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
